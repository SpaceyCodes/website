            Description of the project
        </div>
        <div class="description-block">
            The project was to teach a group of seniors from Yong En Care Centre to use HealthHub, a one-stop portal for
            Singaporeans to access a wide range of health content, rewards and e-services. For this
            workshop, the plan was to showcase and demonstrate 4 main sections of the application, which is “Health
            Articles”, “E-Health Booklet”, “Appointment Booking” and “Health Programmes”. By teaching these sections, we
            hope that the seniors will be able to understand more about the different features in HealthHub and how to
            use them.
        </div>
        <div class="description-block">
            The workshop with Yong En seniors occurred on 3rd June 2021. However due to Covid-19, we were not able to
            teach
            the seniors at the Yong En Care Centre. Instead, we had to conduct the workshop via Zoom. To ensure that
            the presentation was organised smoothly, the class was split into groups of 4-5, where each group will be
            in-charge of a group of seniors.
        </div>
        <div class="description-block">
            As my team knew our target audience were a group of seniors, my group and I knew we had to present the
            workshop in a manner
            that they would understand. This means that out presentation should be easy to follow, non-technical and
            concise. My team also translated the slides so that both english and chinese speaking seniors will be able
            to understand the presentation.
        </div>
        <div class="description-block">
            Through several rehearsals within my team and a dry run with the representives from Yong En, my team members
            where confident that we would be ready for the actual workshop with the seniors. As a result, t.he workshop
            during the actual day was conducted smoothly as there were no major problems that arose
        </div>

        <div class="description-block">
            The project has taught me the importance of good User Interface / User Experience (UI/UX) in mobile
            applications. When navigating around the HealthHub application during the project, I noticed several poor
            UI/UX choices that may be confusing to seniors, like poorly named tabs and confusing navigation. From this,
            I have realised that UI/UX is especially important in applications that are targeting seniors
            who may have trouble remembering which buttons to press or would not understand what certain icons
            represent. As a result, more attention has to be put into UI/UX to ensure that the user will be navigate
            around the application smoothly.
        </div>
        <div class="description-block">
            In addition, I have learnt the importance of understanding your target audience. For this project, the
            class correctly identified our target audience, which are seniors. As a result, we were able to create our
            workshop with senior in mind. So, our slides were concise, non-technical and
            incorporated a lot of screenshots to allow the seniors to understand what is being taught. By correctly
            identifying our target audience, the presentation went smoothly and the seniors had an enjoyable time
            learning.

        <div class="description-block">
            By talking to the elderlies, my team and I understood some of the problems the seniors faced, like being
            unable to keep up with
            technology, not understanding how to use certain government apps, etc. In addition, they also stated their
            interest in learning about technology as they were also attending other workshops like photo montage making
            and cloud storage for photos. This was eye-opening as always thought that elderlies do not like to learn new
            things due to their old age.
        </div>
        <div class="description-block">
            This project has made me notice the importance of multi-language support in web and mobile content. This is
            because there are still many people in the world whose first language is not English. For example, during
            the S-L project, the presentation slides included both English and mandarin descriptions. which allowed
            seniors who only understood mandarin to keep up with the lesson, and learn comfortably. So, by providing
            different language options, online content can be more widely available to people.
